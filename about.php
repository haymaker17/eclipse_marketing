            <p>People know Eclipse Marketing Group by the companies we keep. We keep good companies for a very long time. Our greatest assets are the relationships we've built over the years. We've linked the nation's most reputable electronic component manufacturers and distributors with their OEM customers in the Pacific Northwest since 1946. </p>
            <p>What sets Eclipse apart? Several company policies allow us to posture as a cohesive team: product managers who are responsible for line performance and training; salaried employees whose profit share and bonus depend upon overall company performance not individual performance. We believe these policies enhance teamwork and promote our Dedication to the industry and to each other. </p>
            <p>Our corporate offices are located in Kirkland, WA in the heart of the electronic industry in Washington State. Our Oregon office is located in Beaverton, the center of the "Silicon Forest." Both offices are linked by computer networks and electronic mail, ensuring that principals, customers, distributors and employees all have accurate and timely information. Nine outside sales representatives and four inside support specialists provide complete coverage for the ERA Cascade Chapter territories of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Western Montana, Alaska and British Columbia.</p> 
            <p>Our market consists of over 500 active customers in such segments as Aircraft and Aerospace, Medical and Test Instrumentation, Computers and Telecommunications. We know our market and have made a commitment to our customers to bring them the best possible solutions to their most technologically challenging opportunities. Whether it be surface mount processing or RFI shielding of cable assemblies, Eclipse will always be there first with the most innovative solutions. </p>
            <p>As our name implies, Eclipse will always "Surpass Existing Boundaries." We'd like to put our energies into competing in the marketplace for you. Please contact us today to find out how Eclipse Marketing Group can be of service to your company. </p>
